A script which plugs into Less, applying syntax highlighting to many file types
using source-highlight (https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite).

Installing this one only works on CentOS 7 x86-64 (install.sh will abort otherwise).
Four RPMs, containing source-highlight and its dependencies, are installed system-wide,
which of course requires connecting as root.
