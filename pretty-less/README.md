A script which plugs into Less, applying syntax highlighting to many file types
using source-highlight (https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite).

Installing this one only works on systems which use yum/rpm for dependency management.
Some dependencies (`less` and `source-highlight`, and their own dependencies) are installed
system-wide if needed, which requires connecting as root.
